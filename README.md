I am an Android developer focused on Kotlin, always striving to create functional and intuitive applications. My experience so far is based on personal projects, where I have developed important skills for building modern Android apps, from interface design to backend integration.

While working on personal projects, I have learned to tackle various challenges in mobile development, such as state management, navigation, local storage, and API consumption. I am also familiar with popular libraries like Retrofit for network communication, Room for data persistence, and Koin for dependency injection. Additionally, I value good development practices and have experience creating unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability using frameworks like JUnit and MockK.

My next goal is to deepen my knowledge of Kotlin Multiplatform and further explore backend development to offer more complete and integrated solutions.

üí° Technical Skills:

Kotlin, Java, Jetpack Compose
Retrofit, Room, Coroutines, Flow
Koin, MVVM, Clean Architecture, OOP, SOLID
Integration with RESTful APIs
Git and version control
Kotlin Multiplatform, Compose Multiplatform
Firebase, DataStore
Unit Testing, JUnit, Espresso, MockK, MockWebServer
üìà I am looking for my first professional opportunity as an Android developer to apply what I have learned, grow with a team, and contribute to real projects.

Let's connect and talk about Android development and new opportunities!
